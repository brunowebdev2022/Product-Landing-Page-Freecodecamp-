# Product-Landing-Page-Freecodecamp-
03/29/2022
This project aims to replicate the "Product Landing Page" project from freecodecamp.org. I learned and experienced how to use CSS flexbox and media queries.

From my current understanding, the CSS flexbox's on this project can be found on the <header>, <features>, and <pricing>.

The <header> have two main elements which is the logo/image and navigation menu. These two elements were seperated by viewpoint function and arranged by the default flex direction which is row.

In <features> there are three main elements to consider, the <div class="grid"> element for the box of description and icon, the <div class="description"> element for the description, and the <div class="icon"> element for the logo.

In <pricing> there are four main elements to consider, the <div class="payment"> element for the box of the pricing, <div class="level"> element for the title of the pricing box, <h2> and <ul> for the content of the box, and <button class="btn"> for the selection of pricing.

The media queries on this project can be found on the <header>, <features>, and <pricing>.

These media queries makes the page responsive on the size of the browser and it basically "overwrites" the general css when the rule is triggered.
